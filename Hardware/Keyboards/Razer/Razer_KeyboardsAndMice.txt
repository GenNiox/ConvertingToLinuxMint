PolyChromatic (GUI, user interaction software)

NOTE: For Polychromatic (Ubuntu/Mint version), you'll need to run a "sudo apt update" in the middle of the add-aptrepository and install commands.
Otherwise, you're going to get an error stating that polychromatic either doesn't exist or can't be found.
