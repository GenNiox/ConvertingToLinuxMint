Hello brilliant minds, fellow adventurers, tired, angry, and weary Windows users, and new Linux Mint users,


This GitHub site will be a compilation of anything and everything that I have and will run into to assist with
the average Joe's transition over from Windows to Ubuntu/Linux Mint. By all means, please contribute!
The community can only keep getting better if we all keep working together!

There are truly some brilliant minds out there, I'm glad there's enough of us in a group that we can
get to the point of having an operating system that's truly made for the people, by the people.
I'd add the cliche, but I'll save it. ;)

Now, I don't know about y'all.. but I've been itching to switch to Linux for the longest time now, but never would
in the past 'cause I was afraid of what I would lose in the process.. the only real things I've lost are
a couple of games that use anti-cheat engines (I don't play them anyways..), Adobe's products (oh, darn.. ;D),
and Microsoft's constant reboots at the absolute WORST of times (don't miss that an ounce).

That said, I've learned a TON in the process! I've gained OpenOffice/LibreOffice, GIMP, Document Viewer,
and can choose to reboot my machine whenever I want and it's on MY schedule, not Microsoft's.
Microsoft's become too twisted and information hungry.. then one too many blue screens finally did the trick
for me and gave me the willpower to push through it all.

The intent of this is to pre-blaze through some of the common trails that folks will run into so more of us can switch over to Linux and de-throne Microsoft with far greater ease.
It's about time the transition occurred, for OUR sake.

It's been a long time coming that everyone cut their ties with Microsoft.. and what better time to start than now?

I will be utilizing Linux Mint, myself.. so I won't be using snapd for the foreseeable future.. but this stuff will still work as far as I know. If it doesn't.. welp, you need to switch; Linux Mint is awesome and worth it. ;)

You're free to use whatever distribution you'd like.. though I'd stay away from bleeding edge until you know what you're doing (I'm looking at you, Arch and Debian)! If you want stability, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop! OS, and Manjaro are pretty good (I prefer them in that order). Ubuntu's a little resource-hoggy for me right now and Linux Mint fits
juuuuuuuust right. I'd give it a looksie. Might find it's everything you're looking for. :)

I turned a coworker to it and he said it felt weird.
"I've never installed an OS (operating system) and had it just work."
Yeah, Linux is like that. I can almost guarantee it.

Here's your formula:
Check ProtonDB for the games you hold dear.. see if they work on Linux. The only ones I've come across that don't (like I said earlier) are running the anti-cheat engines. That said, Halo singleplayer works flawlessly. Jussayin'.

Stick with AMD for processors and stay a tad behind the latest and greatest for graphics cards..
it's almost guaranteed that Linux will support it. I'm running a 1070 at the time of writing, and I've seen several 2k series out there.

If they currently don't support something right out of the box.. another brilliant mind is almost guaranteed to be working on it. :)



Yeah, this is the kind of community you're joining. Welcome to the wonderful world of Linux.
Happy Gaming and see you on the battle fields, in the worlds beyond, and deep in the dungeons, friend! ;)
