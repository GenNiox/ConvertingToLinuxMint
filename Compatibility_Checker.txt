Ever wondered what games are supported or run smoothly on Linux via Steam?
Well, now you don't have to wonder! There's a site for it! It's called "ProtonDB".

What a wonderful site.. So, here's what you need to know:
Steam has an.. emulation (for lack of a better term) engine that runs natively on Linux.
This wonderful-wonderful engine will play almost all of your beloved games flawlessly.. some with minor fixes/tweaks.. and so on and so forth.

..this is where ProtonDB comes in. You use this site to check and see what others are experiencing and what they've done to fix it. This is your pre-purchase research all located conveniently in one site.
You'll see what builds and hardware others are running as well as when they uploaded their reviews.

Never once has one led me astray. Everything I've looked up has been true to word.

Here's how you enable/disable this wonderful engine:

1. Sign-in to your Steam account.
2. Go to:
    Steam -> Settings (a window will pop up) -> Steam Play
3. Check the "Enable Steam Play for supported titles" checkbox.
4. Restart the Steam client if needed and sign-in again.
5. Go to the same window:
    Steam -> Settings (a window will pop up) -> Steam Play
6. Check the "Enable Steam Play for all other titles" checkbox.
7. In the "Run other titles with:" drop-down select the latest (highest-number Proton engine)
8. Click "OK" and restart your Steam program or reboot your computer and sign-in again.
9. That's it!


Yeah, seriously.. it's that easy.
Welcome to Linux Gaming!
